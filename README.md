# Binary Classification: The Perceptron Algorithm 
This Folder provides with the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm for the binary classification of a data set along with the  Perceptron pseudocode.


In this Repository:

➊  README            🢂 you are reading this file

➋  Pseudocode        🢂 a straighfoward and 'text-based" algorithmich design for the Perceptron model

➌  Training Data     🢂 contains the data-set used in the training-stage of the algorithm 

➍  Testing Data      🢂 contains the data-set used in the training-stage of the algorithm 


➎  Implementation.py 🢂 this is the Python Script for the implementation of the Binary Perceptron: 

                                 Training phase :    ...
       FIND      🢂                      
                                 Testing  phase  :    ...
